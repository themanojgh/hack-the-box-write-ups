## üìã Findings
The scan revealed:

- Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
- WordPress version: 5.8 (with 41 known vulnerabilities)
- XML-RPC: Enabled (brute-force vector)
- Directory listing: Enabled on /wp-content/uploads/
- Discovered Plugins:
  - wpDiscuz 7.0.4 ‚Äî Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - mail-masta 1.0.0 ‚Äî Local File Inclusion + SQL Injection
  - Contact Form 7
- Enumerated users: admin, doug
- readme.txt and other sensitive files accessible

## üïµÔ∏è Manual Exploration
Found image using attachment ID:
```bash
http://blog.inlanefreight.local/?attachment_id=5
```
Image URL resolved to:
```bash
http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cropped-header1.png
```
## üß† From there, I guessed the directory structure and tried:
```bash
http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/flag.txt
```
‚úÖ Success! The flag was exposed due to insecure upload permissions and directory structure.

# üìò WordPress Plugin Enumeration
During the internal penetration test of inlanefreight.local, I performed plugin enumeration on the WordPress instance hosted at http://blog.inlanefreight.local.

## üîç Methodology
To enumerate active plugins, I fetched the HTML content of a blog page and filtered it using grep:
```bash
curl -s http://blog.inlanefreight.local/?p=1 | grep plugins
```

## üîé Findings
This revealed several WordPress plugins through linked CSS and JavaScript assets:

‚úÖ Detected Plugins:

Plugin Name	| Version	| Path
Contact Form 7	| 5.4.2	| /wp-content/plugins/contact-form-7/
WPDiscuz	| 7.0.4	| /wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/
Mail Masta	| 5.8	| /wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
WP Sitemap Page	| Unknown	Plugin | reference in footer

These plugins can be checked for publicly known vulnerabilities using tools such as:
`wpscan`
`Searchsploit`
`Exploit-DB`

We don't have the version number directly for WP Sitemap Page like other plugins, but try to enumerate more where the plugin might be uploaded.
```bash
http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/plugins/wp-sitemap-page/readme.txt
```

Let's read the file and get the answer of version number.
