After navigating to the provided IP address, I was presented with a login form.

Using the credentials guest for both the username and password, I successfully logged in and accessed the main interface of the application.

The dashboard displayed a list of files, each with multiple available actions: **View, Copy to, Direct Link, and Download**. There was also an **Advanced Search** feature. Screenshots of the interface are included below for reference. This initial exploration helped me understand how the web application handled file operations, which later played a key role in identifying command injection points and exploiting them to retrieve the target flag.

Each action triggered specific HTTP GET requests, and by analyzing how the to, from, and move parameters behaved, I started mapping how file operations were executed on the backend. 

### View
```bash
GET /index.php?to=&view=51459716.txt&quickView=1
```

Initially, attempts to execute commands directly such as `whoami` through either `to=` or `from=` parameters were denied, returning the message **"Malicious request denied."**
**whoami in to**

I discovered that the operator %26%26 is accepted. Based on the error message, itâ€™s clear the server is using the mv command.

Again doing GET /index.php?to=&from=51459716.txt%26%26whoami&finish=1&move=1;whoami gave me the same error
